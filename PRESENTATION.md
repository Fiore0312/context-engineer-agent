## 🌟 **What is AiGENIO?**

AiGENIO is a revolutionary **meta-AI agent** that creates personalized Context Engineering workflows, bridging the gap between human developers and AI coding assistants like Claude Code.

**Think of it as your digital twin for software development.**

---

## 🎯 **The Problem We're Solving**

### Current State of AI Development:
- ❌ **Repetitive Prompting**: Developers waste time crafting the same instructions over and over
- ❌ **Context Loss**: AI assistants forget your preferences and patterns between sessions  
- ❌ **Inconsistent Results**: Different prompts produce varying quality outcomes
- ❌ **Manual Workflow**: Each project requires manual setup and configuration

### The Gap:
**AI assistants are powerful, but they don't know YOU.**
